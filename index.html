<h2>Open Houses</h2>
<p>We will be holding a series of open houses before the application deadline. Each open house will include a general info session, followed by time to speak individually, or in small groups, with editors and staff of the 'Prince.' Individual sections may also hold "office hours," during which you can drop in and ask questions, or just chat. Find updated schedules here.
</p>

<p><strong>Our first open house will be 8:00 pm EDT on Wednesday, August 19th.</strong> You can join via <a href="https://princeton.zoom.us/j/96751149775">this Zoom link</a>. We hope to see you there!</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<button class="collapsible">What is The Daily Princetonian?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>That's a great question! Since 1876, The Daily Princetonian (the 'Prince') has
  served as Princeton University's only daily student news publication. Our paper is
  student-run, not-for-profit, and financially independent from the University.</p>
  <p>This semester, we'll move beyond our regular print paper (though we'll still mail three special issues to all students!) and publish daily coverage across a wide
  range of media, including our redesigned <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com">website</a>, <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/page/subscribe">newsletters</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6DZuLRHcb2Nf6bP3nna9VQ">videos</a>, and
  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/503vf6NjTcdtWUClrwUNaA?si=DqRa6tXbQfi3DMe-Ko9SPA">podcasts</a>. We're also excited to launch brand-new social media and web projects
  teams.</p>
  <p>But the 'Prince' isn't just Princeton's publication of record. We're a <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/article/2020/08/class-of-2024-letter-from-the-editor-welcome-coronavirus-prince-vision">community</a> sustained through friendship, empathy, and dedication, both to our work and to one another. And we'd love for you to join us!</p>
  <p>You can read more about our mission <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/page/about">here</a>.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">What values guide the 'Prince?'</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>This past July, we held a town hall, where many members of our community shared what they believe the 'Prince' can and should be. Together, we identified Community, Transparency, Diversity, and Intentionality as the principles that guide our work. You can read more about each of them <a href="https://www.dailyprincetonian.com/page/about">here</a>.</p>
  <p>We want these convictions to be more than just words; we want to bring them to life in our daily work. This semester, we'll hold a series of conversations, both formal and informal, to gain a deeper understanding of what equity and representation mean for our own newsroom, so that we can make the 'Prince' a model of inclusion, accessibility, and equity. We invite you to join us on this journey.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">How has the 'Prince' community adapted during COVID-19?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Among campus organizations, the 'Prince' is unique, in that our community has only grown closer since the pandemic began. We talk daily with each other, both as colleagues and friends.</p>
  <p>This semester, we can't wait to hold lots of social events, from game nights to virtual pickups, over Zoom, as we welcome you into our community.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">How do I apply to the 'Prince?'</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>We're thrilled you asked! To access our universal application, click <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe2FTBb4Zsz19w1DKeC73OGx5XdICxBhJLgXKCbs6PE5hFdKw/viewform">here</a>. As you'll see, each section has its own supplement, which varies in length (none of them are too long, we promise!). All applications are due by 11:59 pm EDT on Saturday, Sept. 12.</p>
  <p>Unlike many college publications, we are proud to welcome as many new staffers as possible; our only limitation is space. The section-specific supplements allow you to share a bit about your interests, and they aren't designed to pit you against other applicants. If you demonstrate that you're interested in joining the 'Prince,' we'll do our best to find a place for you.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">How many sections may I apply to?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You may apply to up to three sections (the application allows you to rank them preferentially). For each section you select, you'll be required to submit a separate supplement, each of which will be reviewed separately.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">If I become an Opinion columnist, may I contribute to other sections?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>With the exception of Prospect (arts and culture), Opinion columnists may not write for other sections, in keeping with principles of journalistic integrity. You may, however, apply to Opinion and other sections beyond Prospect. If you are accepted to Opinion, your other applications will be nullified.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">To contribute to the 'Prince,' do I need previous experience?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Not at all! Previous experience is never required at the 'Prince.' Some sections may ask you whether you've written for a school newspaper or used certain kinds of software in the past. These questions give our editors a sense of who's coming on board, but they will never have any bearing on your application.
</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">I'm taking a gap year. May I still contribute to the 'Prince?'</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>Regardless of whether you'll be enrolled this year, we encourage you to apply! Depending on how many new staffers are taking gap years, we may create a special team that produces content specially for students on gap years.</p>
</div>
<button class="collapsible">If I have any questions, who may I contact?</button>
<div class="content">
  <p>You're always welcome to contact Jon, our Editor-in-Chief, at <a href="eic@dailyprincetonian">eic@dailyprincetonian.com</a>. Thanks so much for your time and interest in the 'Prince!'</p>

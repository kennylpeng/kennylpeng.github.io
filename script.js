And in journalism, the best way of learning is by doing. Through hands-on editing and open communication with reporters, in addition to comprehensive training, our News Editors are here to help you along that learning curve.</p><p>News reporters are encouraged to write as often as they wish, and there is no commitment to write a certain number of articles. While some of our writers follow “beats” — covering stories specific to either the eating clubs, student government, local politics, or the environment, and developing an expertise in that area — others elect to cover a broad range of stories that interest them. There’s also no story off limits to new writers.</p><p>Our new reporters are also integral to helping us decide what to cover, bringing fresh ideas and perspectives to our section-wide meetings each week. As the News section adapts how we report and tell stories heading into this unprecedented semester, the more new ideas and perspectives the better. </p><p>Above all else, the News section is a community, and we’d love to have you on board.</p><p>If you have any questions about joining the news section, reach out to our editors at news@dailyprincetonian.com. We look forward to hearing from you!</p>"

Our section has two primary responsibilities: layout and graphic design. Most designers work with both after an initial training period. No experience is necessary!</p><p><strong>Layout</strong></p><p>Normally, the ‘Prince’ is a daily paper, and the responsibility of the Design Section is to lay out the physical paper using Adobe InDesign every night before publishing. However, with the fully remote semester, we are shifting gears. In the fall semester, the 'Prince' will be sending daily newsletters and three special print issues to all students. For the first time in 'Prince' history, there will be specially designed newsletters sent to our subscribers and the student body to accompany both these print issues along and special web projects. Designers will be able to launch this new project and determine how these special newsletters will look using Canva and other layout software available. One of the best parts about Design is that because of our collaborations with other sections, you’ll be  getting to know all the other ‘Prince’ staffers from different sections very quickly right from the start! Coming in without any layout experience is very normal, so don't worry if you've never done this before! There’s no pass/fail, time limit, or selection. You can have as much supervision and assistance as you need to feel confident before going solo. And even then, you are always welcome to reach out if you need any help!</p><p><strong>Graphic Design</strong></p><p>The ‘Prince’ Design section also produces graphics and infographics to accompany data-heavy or lengthy stories that would benefit from some visual representation. Examples of previous work by our designers can be found online on our website! If you are interested in being an infographic designer, the normal procedure is that you’ll be paired with a writer and work with them as they write their story to produce something visual to accompany it. No worries if you have no previous experience! We can provide any necessary training.</p><p>We can’t wait for you to join our family!</p>",
